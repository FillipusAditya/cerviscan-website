📌 Multi-Otsu Thresholding for Image Segmentation (Python)
============================================

Description:
------------
This program performs image segmentation using the Multi-Otsu thresholding 
method. Multi-Otsu is an extension of Otsu’s method that calculates multiple 
threshold values to separate an image into different classes (regions of 
intensity). The program generates a binary mask that highlights the most 
prominent segmented region in the image.

Features:
---------
✅ Supports grayscale or single-channel images
✅ Uses Multi-Otsu thresholding with customizable number of classes
✅ Converts segmented regions into a clean binary mask (0 and 255 values)
✅ Compatible with scikit-image for easy integration into computer vision pipelines
✅ Useful for preprocessing tasks in machine learning, medical imaging, or object detection

Usage:
------
1. Provide the path of an input image (e.g., "sample_image.png").
2. Call the function `multiotsu_masking(image_path)`.
3. The function returns a binary mask (numpy array) where the segmented region is highlighted.

Example:
--------
python multiotsu_segmentation.py

This will segment the input image using Multi-Otsu method 
and return the binary mask.
